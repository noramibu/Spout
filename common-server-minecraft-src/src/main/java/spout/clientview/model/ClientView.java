/**
 * This class represents the static circumstances under which a client (typically a player) observes the data sent.
 *
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class represents a set of values that are static within a client's session with the server:
 * i.e. they stay the same for a client during the entire session.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that for the purposes of this class, the session of the client only starts when it is able to have any
 * view of relevant data sent to it. For example, when a player joins, we first present them with the option
 * to accept or decline the resource pack. Until it has been confirmed that the resource pack has been definitively
 * loaded (so the moment after accepting, downloading and successful loading) or not loaded (so the moment it is either
 * confirmed that the player declined the resource pack, that the download failed or that another type of error
 * occurred after which we can be sure the resource pack will not be successfully loaded anymore), that player is not
 * assigned their {@link ClientView} yet. This also implies that we must make sure not to send any relevant
 * data (such as chunks, entities and potentially even the player's inventory - although that can be sent
 * according to a fallback view and updated as necessary) to the player before their view is determined.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Apart from the interval before having definitely loaded or not loaded the resource pack, a player's session
 * (and as such their {@link ClientView} value) lasts from joining the server until disconnecting.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class may be extended to support additional values relevant to certain views
 * (such as the protocol version of the client).
 * </p>
