# Server

## Introduction

Spout lets you add new blocks and items on a Paper server, fully server-side.\
When players join, the new blocks and items will be added client-side too.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatically sends custom content to clients with the Spoutcraft mod
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Works with other clients too, including vanilla
(with/without resource pack)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Support for all Bukkit / Spigot / Paper plugins

A Fabric server mod is planned.
Please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/EduvcVmKS7) if you are interested.

## Installation

The `.jar` file is a drop-in replacement for the Paper JAR, and you can run it the same:

```sh
java -jar spout-26.1.2-R1.5.jar
```

      <td valign="center">
        Spout provides some non-trivial features.
        <br>
        It has been tested, but please report any issues you encounter.
        <br>
        Keep backups, and always proceed with care.

## Adding custom blocks and items

New blocks and items can be added by Paper plugins that support Spout.

### Spout plugin showcase

* [Quark](https://github.com/ModernSpout/Quark-plugin)
* [Chinese paper lamps](https://github.com/ModernSpout/ChinesePaperLamps-plugin)
* [Snowy stone bricks](https://github.com/ModernSpout/SnowyStoneBricks-plugin)

### Creating a Spout plugin

It's very simple:
1. Create a regular Paper plugin
2. Add the Spout API as a dependency
3. Define your content with a data and resource pack

See the step-by-step guide on the
<a href="https://github.com/ModernSpout/Spout/wiki/*-Making-a-Spout-plugin">wiki</a>!

## Current known issues

* Vanilla clients cannot see block display entities, falling blocks and stonecutter recipes for custom blocks.

# Client

## Introduction

Spoutcraft offers extra support for Spout servers.\
It works just like a modloader: when you join a Spout server,
the server's modded content will be downloaded and installed automatically.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Supports non-vanilla block shapes, like vertical slabs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Supports all properties, including breaking speed, light level and textures
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Auto-completion in commands, such as <code>/give</code>

Because it contains no modded block or items of itself, the Spoutcraft client mod is super lightweight.
<br>
It is incredibly fast: a server's modded content is downloaded and installed in less than a second.

## Next

The next goals of the project are:

* More ways to serve the resource pack
* More types of blocks and items

Afterward, goals of the project are:

* Custom block types, item types, block entities and entities
* Using display entities to display custom blocks to vanilla clients

Don't hesitate to suggest ideas, send in PRs (we will take a serious look at every PR, even if it is only a draft),
or ask to join the project as a developer.
