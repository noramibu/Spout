## Introduction

Spout is a Paper server extension that lets Bukkit plugins add new blocks and items server-side.
When players join, the new blocks and items will be sent to their client and added client-side.

Spout requires a Paper server.
<!--A Fabric server mod is also in development.-->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Support for all Bukkit / Spigot / Paper plugins
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Spout plugins are just Paper plugins
that can add blocks and items on Spout servers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Works with all clients,
with special support for clients with the corresponding
<a href="https://github.com/ModernSpout/Spoutcraft">Fabric mod</a>
<br>

## Creating a Spout plugin

It's very simple:
1. Create a regular Paper plugin
2. Add the Spout API as a dependency
3. Define your content with a data and resource pack

See the step-by-step guide on the
<a href="https://github.com/ModernSpout/Spout/wiki/*-Making-a-Spout-plugin">wiki</a>!

<!--
## Next

The next goals of the project are:

* More ways to serve the resource pack
* More types of blocks and items

Afterward, goals of the project are:

* Custom block types, item types, block entities and entities
* Using display entities to display custom blocks to vanilla clients

Don't hesitate to suggest ideas, send in PRs (we will take a serious look at every PR, even if it is only a draft),
or ask to join the project as a developer.
-->
## Current known issues

* Vanilla clients cannot see block display entities, falling blocks and stonecutter recipes for custom blocks.
