## Introduction

Spout lets Spout plugins add new blocks and items server-side.
When players join, the new blocks and items will be sent to their client and also added client-side.

This is the Spout server extension of Paper.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Support for Bukkit / Spigot / Paper plugins
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Add Spout plugins just like Paper plugins
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓&nbsp;&nbsp;Works with the
<a href="https://github.com/ModernSpout/Spout-Fabric-client">Spout client mod</a> and vanilla clients

## Creating a plugin

It's surprisingly simple! See the step-by-step guides on the
<a href="https://github.com/ModernSpout/Spout-Paper-server/wiki">wiki</a>.

## Next

The next goals of the project are:

* More ways to serve the resource pack
* More types of blocks and items

Afterward, goals of the project are:

* Custom block entities and entities
* Using display entities to display custom blocks to vanilla clients

Don't hesitate to suggest ideas, send in PRs (we will take a serious look at every PR, even if it is only a draft),
or ask to join the project as a developer.

## Current known issues

* Custom block display entities and falling custom block entities are not displayed correctly
* Stonecutter recipes work, but do not display correctly
