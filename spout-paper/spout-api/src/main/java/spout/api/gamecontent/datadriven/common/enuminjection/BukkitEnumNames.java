/**
 * A service to determine an {@link Enum#name()} for a new value in a Bukkit enum, based on a source value.
 *
 * <p>
 * Don't use this unless you know what you are doing.
 * The default name for enums is {@code SPOUT_<namespace>_<key>}, for example
 * {@code willow_trees:willow_log} will become {@code SPOUT_WILLOW_TREES_WILLOW_LOG}.
 * With this naming style, it is very unlikely that any issues will come up now or in the future.
 * Other naming styles may lead to collisions or other plugins parsing strings incorrectly.
